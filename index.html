                <h2>ZAHA HADID</h2>
                <p>I graduated in 1977 from the Architectural Association in London, worked as a teaching assistant 
                    at the College of Architecture in 1987, and organized as a visiting professor at several universities 
                    in Europe and America, including Harvard, Chicago, Hamburg, Ohio, Columbia, New York and Yale. <br>
                    I adhered to the deconstructive school of style and modernity in design, and implemented 950 projects
                    in 44 countries. My work is characterized by imagination, as I place my designs in free, loose lines 
                    that are not defined by horizontal or vertical lines. It was also distinguished by its durability. 
                    The projects of the fire station in Germany in 1993, the Italian Art Museum building in Rome in 2009 
                    and the American in Cincinnati, Abu Dhabi Bridge, the London Marine Sports Center, which was dedicated 
                    to the Olympic Games in 2012, the subway station in Strasbourg, the cultural center of Azerbaijan The 
                    scientific center in Walesburg, the steamboat station in Salerino, the ice skating center in Innsbruck 
                    and the Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center in Baku in 2013 are among the most prominent projects that have 
                    deservedly brought me to the world stage. <br>
                    I received many prestigious awards, medals and honorary titles in the arts of architecture, and I was one 
                    of the first women to receive the Pritzker Prize in Architecture in 2004, which is equivalent in value to 
                    the Nobel Prize in Engineering; the Stirling Prize on two occasions; She was awarded the Order of the British 
                    Empire and the Japanese Imperial Medal in 2012.</p>
